                        <h4>My name is Jasfiq Rahman</h4>

                        <p>Why I got into game development and why it excites me so much can be summed up in one sentence: I love playing God!</p>
                        
                        <p>Before I started my dev journey, I wanted to be a novelist. What is similar to me between writing and game dev is that in both cases, 
                            an entire living and breathing world springs forth from my fingertips! That is a feeling I absolutely cherish, and I can easily see myself doing this for years on end. 
                            And after you find yourself a craft like that, you don't think back twice.</p>
                        
                            <p>My learning journey has been an interesting one. I am enrolled in a university and pursuing a computer science degree, 
                            but unfortunately my university does not teach anything related to games. What this meant for me was that I had to teach myself, 
                            and thankfully there is a plethora of resources available nowadays to facilitate that. From my first year in uni I started teaching myself. 
                            It was not always easy, managing both my coursework and making time to learn beyond that. I love learning, and plan on doing it for a long time.</p>
                        
                            <p>I'm at that stage where I am comfortable starting projects of my own. I have been fortunate enough to have had internship opportunities. 
                            These have taught me how to work within frameworks and constraints. Because of the self-taught nature of my study, I am quite comfortable working alone 
                            and need minimal guidance. At the same time, I always appreciate mentorship and actively seek it if it is available. Nobody can guide you better than someone 
                            who has been in a similar place, and there are some things which self-study cannot ever quite capture. </p>
                        <p>I really hope to break into the industry someday. And for that I am actively working towards having more projects and experience under my belt.</p>
                        
                        <p>I am interested in all the working parts which come together to make a game; be it the gameplay, the UI, the NPC and enemy AIs, or just general upkeep and 
                            design of systems. I have been learning Unity and the Unreal Engine, and am confident in both. As such I have been developing my C# and C++ skills, and also 
                            Unreal's Blueprints as well. I have experience in many areas, including optimization, debugging, networking, testing, prototyping., et cetera. I am also familiar 
                            with version control, and use Git for all my projects, both personal and professional.</p>
                        
                        <p>I like to dabble in game design as well, and would certainly like to add it to my kit someday. For now, however, my focus is entirely 
                            on the development side of things, as I work to make my skills and instincts more robust in that aspect.</p>
